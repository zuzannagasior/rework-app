# Rework App
The REwork application was created in order to quickly connect unemployed people with a potential employer without unnecessary formalities. An application in particular is addressed to people who previously performed manual work, odd jobs etc. and who have lost employment due to coronavirus pandemic. The application is also addressed to employers who will need to quickly hire employees in specific industries, e.g. in gastronomy, production, seasonal work, in a given location.

This is a prototype of a mobile application written in React JS created during online edition of hackaton - HackYeah online. The event took place on 3-5 April 2020.
